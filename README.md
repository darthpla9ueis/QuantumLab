# QuantumLab
This repository consists circuits made to run different algorithms using Qiskit in Python. 
Algorithms, ideas and everything else will be explained to the best of my knowledge. I am much more of a theory and concept guy and a rather novice at coding.
Doing this primarily to better my understanding and intuitiveness of what I love studying.
Majority of what will be here (the codes) can be also found else where. What you will find here is an organised implementation of algorithms going from basics of Qiskit to things like Grovers and Shors algorithm.
It will contain interpretations from my perspective and my practice to implement those things.
Every code is verified on IBM Quantum Experience.
I will be using Qiskit library which is opened sourced and developed by IBM.
